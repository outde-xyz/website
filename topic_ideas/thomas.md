# MGs vs CCG

- selection difference (MG subsumed by CG, but not the other way round)
- see adjunction
- no regular backbone

# CCG particle verb issues

- maybe joint paper with Pablo?

# Features as agreement channels

- symmetric VS asymmetric flow of information ==> islands
- incorporate Marina's work

# Linguistic writing

- railroad VS sandbox
- against untyped numbering
- share your data! mini-corpora (even a little data can help, cf. Frank paper)!
- no specialized notation

# Semilinearity, Parikh's theorem, and movement

- link to Makoto's lecture notes: http://makotokanazawa.ws.hosei.ac.jp/FormalGrammar/lecture5.pdf

# tikz advice

- relative positioning
- em instead of pt
- for-loop with pair arguments
- remember=\x as \lastx (initially 0)

# protein linguistics

# what's in the box?

# year in review

# limited IOTSL is star-free

# what if all movement is always from the base position?

# CompLing + field work

# It's all about the base

# what the heck is generalization, what does it cost, and why do we care?

- can be tied into Hayes paper

# Unifiers and dividers

- mathling used to be all about unifying, bringing things together
- with subregular complexity, we're divvying things up again
