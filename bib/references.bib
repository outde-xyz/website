  title		= {The English Noun Phrase in its Sentential Aspect},
  year		= {1987},
  school	= {MIT},
  abstract	= {This dissertation is a defense of the hypothesis that the
		  noun phrase is headed by a functional element (i.e.,
		  "non-lexical" category) D, identified with the determiner.
		  In this way, the structure of the noun phrase parallels
		  that of the sentence, which is headed by Infl(ection),
		  under assumptions now standard within the
		  Government-Binding (GB) framework. The central empirical
		  problem addressed is the question of the proper analysis of
		  the so-called "Poss-ing" gerund in English. This
		  construction possesses simultaneously many properties of
		  sentences, and many properties of noun phrases. The problem
		  of capturing this dual aspect of the Poss-ing construction
		  is heightened by current restrictive views of X-bar theory,
		  which, in particular, rule out the obvious structure for
		  Poss-ing, [NP NP VPing] , by virtue of its exocentricity.
		  Consideration of languages in which nouns, even the most
		  basic concrete nouns, show agreement (AGR) with their
		  possessors, points to an analysis of the noun phrase as
		  headed by an element similar to Infl, which provides a
		  position for AGR; I call this Infl-like element "D". D and
		  Infl belong to the class of non-lexical categories, which I
		  prefer to call functional categories. The analysis in which
		  D heads the noun phrase I call the "DP-analysis".Importing
		  the DP-analysis into English yields an immediate solution
		  for the problem of the Poss-ing gerund: Poss-ing gerunds
		  (and by extension, noun phrases generally) have a more
		  sentence-like structure than hitherto thought, namely, [DP
		  DP's D VPing]. (In non-gerundive noun phrases, "VP" is
		  replaced by a projection of N. This projection of N,
		  despite being a maximal X-bar projection, corresponds to
		  N-bar in the standard analysis.) Current trends in the
		  treatment of minor categories -- so-called "non-lexical"
		  categories -- lead us to a similar conclusion. Until
		  recently, minor categories like complementizers and modals
		  had been treated as syncategorematic. Under current
		  assumptions, however, they participate fully in the X-bar
		  schema. In this way, two simplifications are achieved
		  simultaneously: we eliminate syncategorematic elements. and
		  we acquire an endocentric analysis of the sentence, which
		  had been exceptional in being the only exocentric major
		  category. To make these results fully general, we are led
		  to treat the remaining syncategorematic elements -- in
		  particular, determiners in noun phrases and degree words in
		  adjective phrases -- as heads of full phrases. The analogy
		  with complementizers and modals indicates that determiners
		  and degree words should head nounphrases and adjective
		  phrases, respectively. In other words, determiners are
		  lexical instantiations of "D" in the same way that modals
		  are lexical instantiations of Infl. However, despite the
		  conceptual links, the question of the existence of a
		  functional head of the noun phrase (the DP-analysis), and
		  the question of the place of the determiner, are
		  independent questions, and I treat them separately:
		  Chapters One through Three are concerned predominately with
		  the former question, Chapter Four with the latter. Chapter
		  One provides a brief introduction. In Chapter Two I present
		  the DP-analysis, motivating it by examining languages with
		  agreement between noun and possessor. I also discuss issues
		  raised by the DP-analysis, with emphasis on the parallelism
		  between noun phrase and sentence hypothesized under the
		  DP-analysis. In particular, I treat the question of PRO in
		  the noun phrase; and I show that the numerous differences
		  between sentence and noun phrase do not invalidate the
		  parallelism of structure proposed under the DP-analysis. In
		  Chapter Three I apply the analysis to the three gerundive
		  constructions, Acc-ing, Poss-ing, and Ing-of. Finally, in
		  Chapter Four, I turn to the question of whether the
		  determiner is the lexical instantiation of D, the
		  functional head of the noun phrase.}

		  implementthe base generation analysis using a minimal set
		  of semantically interpretable features, together with a
		  maximally simple universal syntax/semantics correspondence.
		  We show that parametric variation arises because of the
		  different way the features are bundled on functional heads.
		  We further argue that it is the bundling of two features on
		  a single lexical item, together with the correspondence
		  that requires them to be interpreted apart, that is
		  responsible for the displacement property of human
		  languages. Keywords: relatives, wh-movement,

		  resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and
		  epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are
		  generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted
		  to an A'-position, and (c) appositive modifiers are

		  (1) a. The cats chase the mouse every day. b. The mouse is
		  chased by the cats every day.
		  
		  (lb) differs from (la) in two ways. First, the NP that
		  bears the patient or "logical object" semantic role appears
		  as the surface direct object in (la) but as the surface
		  subject in (lb). Second, the main verb in (lb) is
		  morphologicallyderived from the (stem of the) verb in (la)
		  by suffixing the -ed morpheme.Any complete account of the
		  passive construction will have to encompass both of these
		  aspects, the syntactic and the morphological. On this, all
		  are agreed. How to integrate the two components into a
		  unified account is another matter, however, and differing
		  viewpoints abound regarding which component is primary and
		  which is derived, at what level(s) of representation the
		  two are explicitly related, and so on (for a cross section,
		  see Chomsky (1981), Bresnan (1982c), Perlmutter and Postal
		  (1977), Marantz(1981)). Part of the reason for this
		  diversity is that the phenomenain and of themselves do not
		  supply a wide enough range of evidence to guide theoretical
		  decisions in this area. This article will shed new light on
		  these issues by considering interactions of these processes
		  in morphologically complex languages. In particular,it will
		  argue that the morphology and the syntax in this class of
		  cases must be two aspects of a single process. This result
		  in turn will be shown to place strong, substantive
		  constraints on the kind of syntactic framework that should
		  be adopted.}

  abstract	= {Lexico-Logical Form relates in aim to Noam Chomsky's
		  recent works on economy and minimalism: both authors recast
		  the structure of the grammar, revealing its essential
		  properties in the process. In Lexico-Logical Form, Michael
		  Brody meticulously dissects aspects of the Principles and
		  Parameters theory, pares away the extraneous, focuses on
		  core issues, and recreates them in subtle and interesting
		  ways. Brody argues for and discusses aspects of a radically
		  minimalist, nonderivational approach to syntax in which
		  both the central conceptual systems and the lexicon have
		  direct access to the single syntactic representation,
		  called Lexico-Logical Form. He proposes to streamline the
		  syntactic component of the grammar by eliminating syntactic
		  derivation and all syntactic levels of representation other
		  than LF, the interface with the semantic component. A
		  central driving force throughout is the elimination of
		  redundancy in the theory. Since movement characterizes a
		  subset of the relations characterized by chains, the former
		  is eliminated. Since the lexicon must constrain the input
		  to the semantic component, intervening representations are
		  eliminated, and the relationship between the lexicon and LF
		  becomes direct. This timely approach explores a logical
		  next step in the minimalist path.}

  title		= {Intransitive Verbs and Italian Auxiliaries},
  year		= {1981},
  school	= {MIT},
  abstract	= {If we accept some results provided by some recent
		  generative studies on Italian, it will appear that some
		  purely syntactic processes affect the selection between the
		  two aspectual auxiliariesof Italian: essere (be) and avere
		  (have), as in (i) and (ii).
		  
		  (i) a. Giovanni ha voluto venire Giovanni has wanted to
		  come
		  
		  b. Giovanni e' voluto venire Giovanni is (has) wanted to
		  cume
		  
		  (ii) a. Si vorrebbe gia aver comprato quei regali One would
		  like to already have hought those presents
		  
		  b. Quei regali si vorrebbero gia esser~ comprati Those
		  presents one would like to already be (llave) bought
		  
		  In A Restructuring Rule in Italian Syntax, L. Rizzi has
		  argued that in (i)b., but not in (i)a., a process altering
		  the complementation relation between the two verbs has
		  taken place, and that such a process is syntactic. Rizzi as
		  well as other researchers have claimed that caseslike
		  (ii)b. are derived from cases like (ii)a. via application
		  of the syntactic rule of NP-movement. On the basis of this,
		  one will be led to believe that syntactic factors playa
		  role in the selection of the auxiliary in Italian. In this
		  thesis we claim that not only is this belief correct, but
		  that in fact the type of auxiliary reflects certain
		  configurational properties of syntactic structure
		  systematically. This view is supported by the fact that the
		  distribution of auxiliaries is entirely uniform over some
		  well-defined syntactic domains, such as: a. Passives, b.
		  Reflexives (when the reflexive element is a clitic), c.
		  Impersonals, since each of those constructions ti11 take
		  essere invariably, and as in (iii).
		  
		  (iii) a. Giovanni e' stato invitato Giovanni is (has) been
		  invited
		  
		  b. Giovanni si e' vestito Giovanni is (has) dressed himself
		  
		  c. Si sarebbe invitato anche Giovanni One would be (have)
		  invited Giovanni as well
		  
		  On the fact that among the apparently intransitive verbs,
		  some normally select avere, while others select essere as
		  in IIGiovanni ha telefonato/ Giovanni has pholled" versus
		  "Giovanni e r venuto/ Giovanni is (has) cornell, we assume,
		  following some recent studies within Relational Grammar, in
		  particular D. Perlmutter's Impersonal Passives and the
		  Unaccusative Hypothesis, that the class of apparent
		  intransitives is syntactically non-homogeneous, in that
		  with verbs like venire the apparent subject is in fact a
		  direct object at the level at which thematic relations, or
		  the "argument structure" of predicates, are represented.
		  The earlier part of the thesis is devoted to providing
		  evidence for this bifurcation within apparently
		  intransitive verbs. Beside providing an account for facts
		  like those in (i), (ii), (iii) above, in the course of our
		  discussion we will develop several subsystems of the
		  grammar of Italian, test their interaction and examine some
		  extensions to other languages. These subsystems are: The
		  syntax of auxiliary assignment and past participle
		  agreement. The syntax of "subject inversion". The syntax of
		  "reduced relatives". The rule operative in causative and
		  restructuring constructions. The syntax of reflexives.}

  title		= {The Grammar of {Q}: {Q}-Particles and the Nature of
		  Wh-Fronting},
  year		= {2007},
  school	= {MIT},
  abstract	= {The central claim of this thesis is that the agent
		  responsible for a variety of phenomena surrounding
		  wh-operators is not those operators themselves, but rather
		  a distinct element that we label a
		  ‘Q(uestion)-particle’. In many languages, the
		  Q-particle is phonologically empty, and so its role in
		  various phenomena has not yet been recognized. Most
		  importantly, careful study of these Q-particles reveals
		  that the phenomenon known as ‘pied-piping’ does not
		  exist, and that all putative examples of it are actually
		  instances of normal phrasal movement of the Q-particle.
		  This thesis starts from the demonstration that wh-fronting
		  in Tlingit (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon) does
		  not involve a syntactic relationship between the
		  interrogative C and the wh-word. Rather, it involves a
		  probe/Agree relation between C and an overt Q-particle
		  c-commanding the wh-word. Fronting of the wh-word in
		  Tlingit wh-questions is a mere by-product of fronting the
		  projection of the Q-particle. From this core observation, a
		  syntax and semantics for Tlingit wh-questions is developed.
		  Given the strong similarity between the wh-constructions of
		  Tlingit and those of more widely studied languages, the
		  analysis developed for Tlingit is then applied to a range
		  of other languages. It is found that such a ‘Q-based’
		  theory of wh-constructions holds a variety of analytic
		  consequences. Regarding so-called ‘pied-piping
		  structures’, the Q-based theory provides an analysis of
		  such structures where the very concept of ‘pied-piping’
		  is eliminated from the theory of grammar. Furthermore, the
		  Q-based theory provides a semantics for wh-questions that
		  correctly interprets pied-piping structures without
		  recourse to any mechanisms beyond those needed for
		  wh-questions without pied-piping. Finally, the Q-based
		  theory accounts for various constraints on pied-piping, and
		  correctly predicts the scope and limits of its variation
		  across languages. Beyond its treatment of pied-piping, the
		  Q-based theory also provides a novel syntax and semantics
		  for multiple wh-questions, which successfully ties the
		  presence of Superiority Effects to the absence of
		  Intervention Effects, and which correctly predicts a
		  previously unnoticed Intervention Effect in English.
		  Moreover, it provides a novel, unified account of the
		  ill-formedness of left branch extractions, as well as of
		  preposition stranding.}

		  this approach is connected to the traditional study of

		  about the structure and in its specific conclusions about

		  Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first

		  the same time, it has become apparent that these

  address	= {Cambridge, MA},
  abstract	= {his vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series
		  contains a Preface & 13 Chpts. It explores certain issues
		  related to the theories of government & bounding as
		  elaborated in the "principles & parameters" model of
		  Universal Grammar. The central idea is that the categories
		  that act as barriers to government & those that act as
		  barriers to movement can be treated in a unified way. (1)
		  X-Bar Theory - outlines a theory of phrase structure based
		  on the notion that both lexical & nonlexical categories
		  project according to the same general schemata. Thus, INFL
		  (I) & COMP (C) are no longer conceived of as defective
		  categories. The maximal projection of C (C" or CP)
		  corresponds to the traditional S', the maximal projection
		  of I (I" or IP) to the traditional S. (2) Theory of
		  Movement - sets forth the basic principles governing the
		  rule Move a. Substitution & adjunction are distinguished.
		  Substitution is restricted to minimal (ie, X(degrees)) &
		  maximal (ie, X") projections, X(degrees) being allowed to
		  move only to the head position & X" being allowed to move
		  only to the specifier position. Adjunction is possible to a
		  nonargument X" only. Several novel conceptions follow from
		  these assumptions. Wh-movement, for example, becomes
		  movement to the specifier position of C", as opposed to
		  movement to COMP; maximal categories, moreover, are allowed
		  to adjoin to VP. (3) Government - defines the notions of
		  "c-command" & "government." Consideration of the special
		  properties of adjunction structures leads to a definition
		  of "government" in terms of exclusion rather than
		  domination. (4) Barriers - explores the factors upon which
		  the concept of barrier is contingent. It is suggested that
		  maximal categories are never inherently barriers. They may
		  become barriers, with respect to a given category g, either
		  by being a "blocking category" (BC) for g or by immediately
		  dominating a BC for g. A BC for a category g is, in
		  essence, a maximal category dominating g that is a
		  complement, ie, a th-marked sister of a lexical head. (5)
		  Proper Government - examines the sort of data motivating
		  the Empty Category Principle, in an effort to formally
		  characterize the notion of proper government in the new
		  framework. H. Lasnik's & M. Saito's (see LLBA 18/4,
		  8406650) proposal that antecedent government (chain
		  coindexing) constitutes an instance of proper government is
		  adopted & justified. It is argued further that a lexical
		  head properly governs its complements. (6) Subjacency -
		  considers how wh-movement must be assumed to function. The
		  problem is that IP & VP are barriers (by definition) for
		  the complements of V. Any direct movement of a verbal
		  complement to the specifier position of CP therefore
		  involves crossing two barriers. The assumption that phrases
		  may adjoin to VP is shown to provide a means of denying
		  barrierhood to both VP & IP. (7) Island Violations - shows
		  how replacing the notion of bounding node with that of
		  barrier yields a unified account of various island
		  phenomena, including violations of the Subject Condition,
		  the Adjunct Island Condition, the Complex Noun Phrase
		  Constraint, & the Wh-Island Condition. (8) The Minimality
		  Condition - argues for a condition blocking government of a
		  complement by a more remote head when a closer head is
		  available. Certain empirical consequences follow from such
		  a condition. In particular, an explanation emerges for the
		  fact that the subject of an NP may be wh-extracted in the
		  Romance langs. (9) Vacuous Movement - advances the
		  hypothesis that, whereas wh-movement must occur at the
		  level of Logical Form, it need not occur at S-Structure.
		  This hypothesis sheds light on several problematic
		  phenomena of Eng & provides a simple means of handling the
		  difference between Eng & langs like Chinese & Japanese that
		  have wh-in-situ for simple interrogatives. (10) Parasitic
		  Gaps - presents arguments for treating parasitic gaps as
		  variables bound by an empty operator distinct from whatever
		  operator binds the licensing gap. A chain composition
		  algorithm links the chains of the two gaps. Alternative
		  conditions aimed at explaining licensing gap asymmetries
		  are considered. (11) A-Chains - addresses the issue of head
		  movement, focusing on the process by which V moves to the
		  head position I of IP, forming an inflected element & then
		  moves to the head position of CP, as in the Eng Aux
		  Inversion phenomenon. The discussion leads to the
		  conclusion that head-to-head movement forms an A-chain. The
		  chain coindexing condition that emerges appears to make it
		  possible to reduce proper government to antecedent
		  government. (12) Some Further Problems - considers possible
		  solutions to various subsidiary problems, such as those
		  posed by the impossibility of wh-extraction from
		  predication structures, asymmetries regarding extraction
		  from NPs, the structure of gerunds, & Exceptional
		  Case-Marking configurations. (13) Summary - briefly reviews
		  the proposed theory. Bibliog}

  abstract	= {This vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monographs series
		  contains 7 Chpts addressing the nature of economy
		  conditions in Noam Chomsky's minimalist program, responding
		  in particular to Chomsky's bare phrase structure theory. It
		  is proposed that economy is local; ie, economy constraints
		  do not require the comparison of whole derivations but
		  imply evaluation of candidate operations in terms of
		  information available in the set of syntactic objects to
		  which the operations apply. An analysis of locative &
		  quotative inversion is argued to give strong empirical
		  support to the proposal, which is held to be theoretically
		  superior to global economy proposals in that (1) it does
		  not require the grammar to have an operation-counting
		  apparatus & (2) it sharply constrains possibilities in each
		  economy analysis during a derivation. Last resort &
		  minimality are reinterpreted as local conditions, & the
		  shortest derivation requirement & procrastinate are
		  eliminated; exceptional case marking & successive cyclicity
		  are explained by asymmetric feature checking. Binary
		  branching follows from minimality, strict cyclicity is
		  derived from the linear correspondence axiom, & improper
		  movement is constrained by local last resort. Bibliog. J.
		  Hitchcock}

  abstract	= {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping
		  between syntax & phonology - in particular, that aspect of
		  phonology that determines the linear ordering of words. We
		  propose that linearization is restricted in two key ways.
		  (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the end of
		  each phase, or "Spell-out domain"; & (2) ordering
		  established in an earlier phase may not be revised or
		  contradicted in a later phase. As a consequence, overt
		  extraction out of a phase P may apply only if the result
		  leaves unchanged the precedence relations established in P.
		  We argue first that this architecture ("cyclic
		  linearization") gives us a means of understanding the
		  reasons for successive-cyclic movement. We then turn our
		  attention to more specific predictions of the proposal: in
		  particular, the effects of Holmberg's Generalization on
		  Scandinavian Object Shift; & also the Inverse Holmberg
		  Effects found in Scandinavian "Quantifier Movement"
		  constructions (Rognvaldsson (1987); Jonsson (1996);
		  Svenonius (2000)) & in Korean scrambling configurations (Ko
		  (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal makes
		  predictions that cross-cut the details of particular
		  syntactic configurations. For example, whether an apparent
		  case of verb fronting results from V-to-C movement or from
		  "remnant movement" of a VP whose complements have been
		  removed by other processes, the verb should still be
		  required to precede its complements after fronting if it
		  preceded them before fronting according to an ordering
		  established at an earlier phase. We argue that
		  "cross-construction" consistency of this sort is in fact
		  found. 68 References. Adapted from the source document},

		  "lexical relational structure" (LRS), a lexically
		  represented syntax of a verb's argument structure, is
		  proposed. An analysis of the formation of denominal verbs
		  involving LRS is presented, & it is shown that restrictions
		  on incoporation can be stated naturally in terms of LRS. It
		  is argued that the limited set of thematic role types in
		  linguistic theory can be seen as an artifact of LRS, &
		  alternative accounts of thematic role & thematic role
		  assignment in terms of LRS are explored. Restrictions on
		  the verbs that may occur in various verbal constructions
		  (eg, the causatives, middles, & inchoatives) are discussed
		  in terms of LRS. It is also argued that, given a theory
		  incorporating LRS, the syntactic principles of unambiguous
		  projection & full interpretation apply to the projection of
		  lexical categories. A final section is devoted to
		  qualifying the distinction between syntax (as per its
		  commonly understood definition in linguistic theory) & the
		  lexical "syntax" of LRS & to discussing issues in the
		  treatment of sentential subjects that result from the
		  positing of LRS. 60 References. J. Easton}

		  the claim that once 0-features are allowed into the theory,

		  seen as violating the inclusiveness condition. A theory is

		  Chomsky's (1995) version of the minimalist program. In

		  We examine the transient stack states of a top-down parser

		  formalizes the leading idea of ``memory burden'' in a way

  abstract	= {In Bambara, problems concerning transitivity appear in

		  These problems are shown to arise from the interaction of
		  verb movement & the property specific to Bambara that case
		  cannot be transmitted along a verbal chain. It is argued
		  that this property follows from a particular setting of a
		  parameter that either allows or disallows case chains (CCs)
		  in a particular language. In general, CCs can never be
		  formed in Bambara. In the nominal system, the lack of CCs
		  accounts for the fact that syntactic NP movement occurs in
		  more configurations than in a language such as English, &
		  for the absence of expletive pronouns that transmit case at
		  S-structure. It is suggested that the absence of CCs has
		  consequences for the syntax of predicate nominals, & may
		  explain the absence of nominal small clauses & syntactic
		  wh-movement in Bambara. 2 Tables, 49 References. Adapted

		  suggestion by Noam Chomsky (The Logical Structure of
		  Linguistic Theory, Chicago: U of Chicago Press, [1955]
		  1975) that simple datives like John sent a letter to Mary
		  derive from an underlying form in which the V & indirect O
		  make up a constituent that excludes the direct O. The
		  specific proposal adopted here is that such datives involve
		  an underlying clauselike VP whose "subject" is a letter &
		  whose "object" is to Mary: this inner constituent is
		  obscured at S-structure by V raising. With this view of
		  dative complementation, double Os can be derived by a
		  modern form of dative shift. Specifically, they can be
		  produced by applying the familiar operations responsible
		  for passives within VP. The former indirect O (Mary)
		  becomes a derived VP subject, & the former direct O assumes
		  adjunct status within V'. This structure is shown to
		  account for a variety of properties of the double O
		  structure, including "domain asymmetries" discussed
		  recently by A. Barss & H. Lasnik (see LLBA 20/3, 8604829).

		  effect, that-omission, & tense (T) to complementizer (C)
		  movement - receive a unified explanation under the
		  minimalist hypotheses that (1) syntactic movement is
		  triggered exclusively by an uninterpretable feature that
		  has the extended projection principle (EPP) property as a
		  subfeature & that (2) uninterpretable features marked for
		  deletion may persist for a while before they are required
		  to disappear at the end of the derivation. It is proposed
		  that C has an uninterpretable tense feature uT with the EPP
		  property & that uT is matched by nominative case on the
		  determiner head D; although uT on the subject DP is marked
		  for deletion through the establishment of a relationship
		  between uninterpretable phi-features on T & the
		  interpretable phi-features on DP, it persists through the
		  construction of the CP projection & is therefore able to
		  delete uT on C. The impossibility of T-to-C movement in a
		  subject wh-question is due to economy; that is analyzed as
		  T moved to C in all clauses, & that-omission is explained
		  under a proposed asymmetric match condition by a claim that
		  declarative clauses are nominative if introduced by that &
		  are not nominative otherwise. 141 References. J.

  abstract	= {An analysis of long-distance & clause-bounded
		  reflexivization suggests that principles of the binding
		  theory are not subject to parametric variation. Asymmetries
		  between the two sorts of reflexivization are related to
		  other well-known asymmetries between arguments, adjuncts, &
		  X0s with respect to extraction. Following Noam Chomsky
		  (Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use, New
		  York: Praeger, 1986), anaphors are taken to be clitic-like
		  elements that undergo movement in order to be
		  antecedent-governed. The binding theory then applies only
		  to the reflexive's trace. Clitics are held to be of two
		  types, with some cliticizing onto Infl at S-structure &
		  others at LF, long-distance reflexives like Icelandic sig
		  being of the latter sort. It is further proposed that a
		  reflexive trace can circumvent the specified subject
		  constraint through an escape hatch, eg, the head of CP. The
		  phenomena of long-distance reflexivization is taken as
		  evidence that both antecedent-government & the binding
		  principles contribute to the derivation of binding facts.
		  Neither theory is reducible to the other, thus strongly
		  supporting a modular conception of language. M. Israel}

		  distance in tensed sentences & infinitives in French &
		  English, it is argued that the structure of English &

		  tense morphemes are shown to be heads of two different
		  maximal projections, Tense Phrase (TP) & Agreement Phrase
		  (AGRP), respectively. There also exists a Negative Phrase
		  (NegP) in the two languages. TP, AGRP, & NegP are barriers
		  for V-movement rules, & the surface differences between
		  French & English in the areas mentioned are shown to follow
		  as an automatic consequence from the properties of
		  universal grammar on the one hand & an opacity vs
		  transparency parameter ultimately related to the
		  morphological poverty/richness of AGR on the other.
		  Standard generative grammar analyses of the English &
		  French AUX(iliary) systems are taken up in a new form (eg,
		  that in Noam Chomsky [1957, no further information
		  provided]) & it is shown how the theoretical framework of
		  Chomsky (1986, no further information provided) provides
		  real explanations to old puzzles that had no answer in
		  previous models. Also offered are analyses of V-movement
		  for a variety of Romance languages, comparative analyses of

		  for cross-linguistic behavior of anaphors. Three binding
		  domains & two types of anaphor are distinguished:
		  SELF-anaphors are bound within a local domain & obey the
		  specified subject condition (SSC); SE-anaphors are bound in
		  a medium-distance (MD) domain & obey the tensed S condition
		  (TSC); & both anaphors may appear in a logophoric domain,
		  which is not (directly) subject to the structural binding
		  theory. SE- & SELF-anaphors differ in their lexical
		  structure: the former lack (phi)-features & so are unable
		  to project an independently interpretable argument; the
		  latter are analyzed as relational nouns expressing an
		  identity relation between some pro-form & another argument.
		  An analysis in terms of LF-movement posits two landing
		  sites for anaphors: SE-anaphors adjoin to Io (hence the
		  TSC-effects) & SELF-anaphors adjoin to Vo (hence the
		  SSC-effects). In order to account for complementarity
		  effects holding between SELF-anaphors & pronominals, &
		  between SELF- & SE-anaphors, both conditions A & B are
		  reformulated in terms of thematic structure.
		  Counterexamples to the proposal are considered, & some open
		  & language-specific problems are identified. A brief
		  account of logophoricity, the conditions that give rise to
		  it, & its interaction with the proposed binding theory is
		  included. M. Israel}

		  All other aspects of anaphora are treated as referential

		  argued to liberate binding conditions A & B to account for
		  the syntax & semantics of reflexive predicates in languages
		  where current stages of binding theory do not work
		  correctly. Evidence of asymmetry between conditions A & B
		  is interpreted to show that condition A applies to
		  syntactic predicates only, condition B to semantic
		  predicates only. It is argued in this connection that only
		  verbal heads can form syntactic predicates whereas verbal,

		  pronouns, simplex anaphors, & complex anaphors,
		  distinguishing the roles of the computational system,
		  interpretive procedures, & discourse storage. It argues for
		  a general principle of economy counting interpretive steps.
		  Locality conditions on binding are shown to follow from
		  this economy principle & independent principles of
		  (minimalist) syntax, providing the means to encode certain
		  dependencies, most economically, within the computational
		  system. It shows that the role of complex anaphors in
		  licensing reflexivization follows from an interpretive
		  condition holding at the conceptual-intentional interface.

		  structure is proposed whereby activation of the

		  splits CP into (1) a force projection ForceP specifying
		  illocutionary force & dominating the entire tree, & (2) a
		  finiteness projection FinP selecting a finite or nonfinite
		  IP complement. In Italian, a focused phrase occupies a
		  nonrecursive focus projection that may be surrounded by
		  recursive topic projections, all of which are dominated by
		  (1) & dominate (2). For economy reasons, in the absence of
		  topic & focus activation, the force & finiteness
		  specifications are executed from a single syncretic CP.
		  Many adjacency effects in nonfinite constructions follow
		  from subject Case assignment in the finiteness head. This
		  CP structure is argued to account for constraints on
		  subject extraction in French & English & for anti-adjacency
		  effects in English associated with preposed adverbs &

  abstract	= {Under the view of nominative Case taken by Chomsky (2000,
		  2001), one would expect nominative to be the marked or
		  complex Case, being merged after accusative. In fact,
		  however, it is the other way around, nominative
		  preconditioning accusative & also being the Case of simple
		  structures (unaccusative, etc.). The article argues that
		  this Nominative Puzzle is not real, the nominative argument
		  in fact being the first argument merged, raised across the
		  accusative later in the derivation for independent reasons.
		  This approach not only accounts for the dependency
		  correlation between accusative & nominative (Burzio's
		  Generalization), but also offers a derivational account of
		  Condition A correlations (anaphors being merged higher than
		  their "antecedents"). Importantly, it also makes it
		  possible to explain Icelandic quirky constructions in terms
		  of a general matching theory. In addition, the article
		  develops a novel approach to Move as applying for the
		  purpose of successful feature matching. 71 References.

  abstract	= {Richard Kayne's (1994) linear correspondence axiom is
		  reduced in the framework of Noam Chomsky's bare phrase
		  structure by (1) converting the base step, which makes
		  precedence conditional on command, to a theorem that
		  follows from optimality, & (2) deducing the induction step
		  of the axiom trivially from an assumption that permits
		  dynamically split access to interpretation. It is proposed
		  that spell-out applies only to a command unit formed by
		  continuous application of Merge to a single object & that
		  separate command units require multiple spell-out. Two
		  versions of multiple spell-out are detailed - a
		  conservative version in which phrase markers after
		  spell-out cease to be phrasal, functioning instead like a
		  lexical compound, & a radical version in which interphrasal
		  association is accomplished in performative components.
		  This system is claimed to be more dynamically derivational
		  than that of Chomsky (1995) & to be conceptually
		  indistinguishable from that of Chomsky's "Minimalist
		  Inquiries: The Framework" (1998). 42 References. J.

		  two opposing analyses of the construction: the small clause

		  "subject as external argument." It is argued that a SC
		  analysis of these constructions would require NP, VP to be
		  defined as a structural subject in constructions such as
		  Bill considers John sick. An added benefit of considering
		  predication theory as an adequate analysis of these
		  constructions is that it recognizes predicates & subjects.
