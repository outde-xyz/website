<!-- START_SUMMARY_BLOCK -->
Sometimes students get hung up on the difference between **substring** and **subsequence**.
Well, despair no more, I have found the perfect exercise to practice that difference.
<!-- END_SUMMARY_BLOCK -->

Enter John Carter, Jeddak of Jeddaks, Warlord of Mars, depicted here with his devoted wife, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, daughter of Mors Kajak, who is Jed of Helium and son to Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium.

And here we have two of John Carter's most loyal friends.
First, Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark.

And then there's Kantos Kan, Jedwar of the Heliumetic navy.

![Kantos Kan, in a Barsoomian painting of unmatched verisimilitude](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/barsoom/images/a/a2/Kantos-Kan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120713232546)

Kantos Kan has the rare distinction of having a last name that is a **substring** of the first name.
After all, **Kan***tos* = **Kan** + *tos*.

That's not the case for Tars Tarkas.
While the first name and last name share a common **prefix** *Tar*, neither one is an extension of the other.
But Tars is a **subsequence** of Tarkas, which is **Tar** + *ka* + **s**.

So substrings are **Kantos Kan strings**, and subsequences are **Tars Tarkas sequences**.
Okay, your turn.
For each one of the following pairs, say whether one is

- a Kantos Kan string of the other,
- a Tars Tarkas sequence of the other,
- neither.

1. *Jed* and *Jeddak*
1. *Tars* and *Thark*
1. *Jeddak* and *Jedwar*
1. *Thoris* and *Tardos Mors*
1. *Tars* and *Tardos Mors*
1. *Dejah Thoris* and *Dor*

**Bonus exercise**: Explain why I didn't allow a fourth option "both" in the exercise.
